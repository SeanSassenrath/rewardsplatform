Progress of mock up of city view of individual halos:

For right now, halos will be static/an image will act as a place holder for the halos.
Working with mock up data.

Working to use a D3 overlay on Google Maps to view the city and individual halos.

One element in mock-up data:
{
    "coordinates": [<latitude>, <longitude>],
    "halo": <img file path(?)>,
    "user": <user data, but for now just a username>
}
